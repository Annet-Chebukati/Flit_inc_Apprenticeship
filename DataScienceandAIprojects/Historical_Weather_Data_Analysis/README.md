# API-Driven Historical Weather Data Analysis with Weatherstack and Tableau

In this project, the Weatherstack API is used to gather historical weather data for various locations. This data includes essential factors like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and more. A data processing pipeline is established that fetches this information, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and conducts a comprehensive historical weather analysis. Furthermore, Tableau is used for creating engaging visualizations that bring the data to life.

## Tools
- **Python**
- **API â€“ Weatherstack**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **GitHub**
- **Tableau**

## Objective
The objective of this project is to harness the Weatherstack API to collect historical weather data for locations around the world. A data pipeline is built for retrieving weather data, storing it in a PostgreSQL database, and leveraging Tableau for insightful data visualizations.

## High-Level Steps
1. **Data Collection via Weatherstack API**
2. **Data Storage**
3. **Data Ingestion**
4. **Historical Weather Analysis**
5. **Tableau Data Visualization**
6. **Documentation and Presentation**

## Deliverables
- A Python script for interfacing with the Weatherstack API to retrieve historical weather data.
- A PostgreSQL database containing the gathered historical weather data.
- SQL queries or analysis scripts for conducting the historical weather analysis.
- Engaging Tableau visualizations that effectively convey the outcomes of the analysis.
- Comprehensive project documentation and a presentation to communicate your findings and insights.
