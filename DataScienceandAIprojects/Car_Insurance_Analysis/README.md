# Car Insurance Analysis with BigQuery, Tableau, and Google Data Studio

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset from a Car Insurance company. Utilizing a combination of data analysis and visualization tools, I will develop insightful dashboards designed for insurance analysis. The project caters to two distinct audiences: upper management, who will use Tableau, and operational teams, who will rely on Google Data Studio.

## Tools and Technologies
- Google BigQuery: Used for data storage and querying.
- Tableau: Employed for creating dashboards for upper management.
- Google Data Studio: Utilized for crafting operational dashboards.
- GitHub: The primary platform for version control and sharing the project's codebase.

## Process and Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Begin by importing the car insurance dataset into Google BigQuery, ensuring the data is clean and structured for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Conduct an initial exploration to understand the data's characteristics and identify any patterns.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Create dashboards in Tableau for upper management and another operational dashboard in Google Data Studio.
4. **Presentation**: The findings will be presented to the relevant stakeholders.

## Key Deliverables
- A Google BigQuery dataset with car insurance data.
- A Tableau dashboard tailored for upper management.
- A Google Data Studio dashboard designed for operational use.
- A comprehensive GitHub repository housing all documentation and code related to the project.
