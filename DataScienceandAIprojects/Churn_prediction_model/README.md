# Churn Prediction Model and Heroku Deployment

As a data scientist for a telecoms company, this project involves working with customer data, including features like gender, tenure, internet service, payment method, and churn status. The goal is to create a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service). Additionally, this model will be deployed on Heroku, allowing for real-time predictions.

## Tools
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.
- **Heroku**
- **GitHub**

## Objective
In this project, a machine learning model will be built to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and deploying the model on Heroku, making it accessible online.

## High-Level Steps
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
2. **Machine Learning Model**
3. **Heroku Deployment**
4. **User Interface**
5. **Tableau Dashboards publishing**
6. **Documentation and Presentation**

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook or script containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Deployed churn prediction model on Heroku.
- Documentation explaining the project and how to use the deployed model.
- A web-based user interface for interacting with the model.
