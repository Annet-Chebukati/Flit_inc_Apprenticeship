# Hotel Reservation Analysis in SQL and Tableau

## Objective
The goal of this project is to work with a hotel reservation dataset that contains information about reservations at two types of hotels: Resort Hotels (H1) and City Hotels (H2). I will use SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization to gain insights and create impactful visualizations.

## Tools
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Athena)
- Tableau
- GitHub

## Steps
**1. Data Import:**
- Import the hotel reservation dataset into your preferred SQL environment.

**2. Data Exploration:**
- Explore the dataset to understand the variables and the relationships between them.

**3. SQL Analysis:**
- Use SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

**4. Tableau Visualization:**
- Create visualizations in Tableau based on my findings from the SQL analysis.

**5. GitHub Repository:**
- Maintain a GitHub repository with all my scripts, code, and visualizations.

**6. Tableau Dashboards publishing:**
- Publish my Tableau dashboards for easy access and sharing.

**7. Presentation:**
- Prepare a presentation or report summarizing my findings and recommendations.

## Deliverables
- SQL environment with imported dataset and SQL scripts.
- Published tableau dashboard.
- A presentation or report summarizing your findings and recommendations.
- A GitHub repository with documentation and code.
