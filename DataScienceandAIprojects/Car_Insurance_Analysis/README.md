## Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset from a Car Insurance company. Utilizing a combination of data analysis and visualization tools, I will develop insightful dashboards designed for insurance analysis. The project caters to two distinct audiences: upper management, who will use Tableau, and operational teams, who will rely on Google Data Studio.

## Tools and Technologies
- Google BigQuery: Used for data storage and querying.
- Tableau: Employed for creating dashboards for upper management.
- Google Data Studio: Utilized for crafting operational dashboards.
- GitHub: The primary platform for version control and sharing the project's codebase.

## Process and Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Begin by importing the car insurance dataset into Google BigQuery, ensuring the data is clean and structured for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Conduct an initial exploration to understand the data's characteristics and identify any patterns.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Create dashboards in [Tableau for upper management](https://public.tableau.com/views/CarInsuranceAnalysis_17042135260620/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and another [operational dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/14ab11f1-8f88-4602-8319-66aff18c737b) in Google Data Studio.
4. **Presentation**: The findings will be presented to the relevant stakeholders.
